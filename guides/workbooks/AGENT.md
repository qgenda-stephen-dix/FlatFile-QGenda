# Workbooks

### Overview

Workbooks are analogous to a database, with a type-strict schema configuration. They replace traditional spreadsheet templates used for data collection during customer onboarding or file-based data exchange processes. Unlike spreadsheets, Workbooks enable real-time validation, correction, and data import with immediate feedback.

#### Key Capabilities

- Multi-format support beyond CSVs (with extensible file extractors)
- Automatic validation based on predefined rules
- User-friendly interface for data manipulation (add, remove, review, filter, correct)
- Configurable primary Actions for data submission to APIs, databases, or workflows

### Anatomy of a Workbook

A Workbook is represented as an object within an array of workbooks:

```typescript
import { Flatfile } from "@flatfile/api";

const workbook = {
  name: "Data Import Workbook",
  labels: ["pinned"],
  sheets: [
    // Array of Sheet configurations
  ],
  actions: [
    // Array of Action configurations
  ],
  settings: {
    trackChanges: true,
    noMappingRedirect: false,
  },
};

// This workbook would be part of an array when configuring a space
const workbooks = [workbook];
```

#### 1. Sheets Array

Sheets are like database tables or spreadsheet sheets, each with its own schema:

```typescript
sheets: [
  {
    name: "Customers",
    slug: "customers",
    fields: [
      // Field configurations
    ],
  },
  {
    name: "Orders",
    slug: "orders",
    fields: [
      // Field configurations
    ],
  },
];
```

#### 2. Actions Array

Developer-defined operations that users can trigger on selected data:

```typescript
actions: [
  {
    id: "submit-to-api",
    label: "Submit to API",
    description: "Send validated data to external API",
    primary: true,
  },
  {
    id: "download-pdf",
    label: "Download as PDF",
    description: "Export data as PDF report",
  },
];
```

#### 3. Settings Object

Configuration options for Workbook behavior:

```typescript
settings: {
  // Disable actions when commits are pending
  trackChanges: true,

  // Prevent automatic redirect to mapping on file drop
  noMappingRedirect: false,

  // Additional settings as needed
}
```

#### 4. Labels Array

Organizational and UI-related configurations:

```typescript
labels: [
  "pinned", // Makes workbook appear first in sidebar
  "custom-label", // Custom organizational labels
];
```

### Example Workbook Configuration

```typescript
export const importWorkbook = {
  name: "Product Import System",
  labels: ["pinned"],
  sheets: [
    Products, // Sheet configuration from separate file
    Categories, // Sheet configuration from separate file
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      id: "submit",
      label: "Submit Data",
      description: "Submit validated data to database",
      primary: true,
    },
  ],
  settings: {
    trackChanges: true,
    noMappingRedirect: false,
  },
};

// This workbook would be used as part of an array when configuring a space
const workbooks = [importWorkbook];
```

### Best Practices for Workbooks

1. **Organization**

   - Group related sheets in a single workbook
   - Use meaningful workbook names
   - Implement appropriate actions for data processing

2. **Configuration**

   - Enable `trackChanges` for data integrity
   - Configure `noMappingRedirect` based on UX requirements
   - Use labels effectively for organization

3. **Actions**

   - Define clear primary actions
   - Include helpful action descriptions
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Provide feedback during processing

4. **Settings**
   - Configure settings based on use case
   - Document any custom settings
   - Consider UX impact of settings
